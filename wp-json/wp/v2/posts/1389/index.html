We recommend small boxes for heavier items like books and large ones for lighter bulkier things such as bedding or lampshades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a variety of box sizes helps to optimise space in the moving truck and reduces risks associated with improperly packed items. It also makes unpacking significantly easier as you can clearly label each box based on its contents and where it belongs in your new home, improving efficiency during the stressful move-in process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div aria-hidden='\"true\"' class='\"wp-block-spacer\"' style='\"height:25px\"'><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class='\"wp-block-heading\"'>Bubble wrap and packing paper<\/h3>\n\n\n\n</h3><p>Bubble wrap and packing paper are essential tools for self-packers.
